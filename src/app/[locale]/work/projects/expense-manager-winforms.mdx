## Overview

A personal expense management desktop application built with WinForms and .NET 8. This project focuses on simplicity, user experience, and helping users build consistent expense tracking habits through daily reminders.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8.0** - Latest .NET framework
- **WinForms** - Desktop UI framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for data persistence
- **SQLite** - Lightweight local database
- **Windows Task Scheduler** - Daily reminder integration

## Key Features

### 1. Expense Tracking
- Quick expense entry form
- Category organization (Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
- Date and amount recording
- Notes for each transaction
- Edit and delete capabilities

### 2. Daily Reminder System
- **Automatic notification at 21:00 every day**
- Windows notification popup
- Reminds user to log daily expenses
- Helps build consistent tracking habits
- Can be customized or disabled

### 3. Expense Categories
- Predefined categories
- Custom category creation
- Category-based filtering
- Color coding for visual organization

### 4. Reporting & Analytics
- Daily, weekly, monthly expense summaries
- Category-wise breakdown
- Spending trends
- Simple charts and visualizations
- Export to Excel for detailed analysis

### 5. Simple, Clean UI
- Intuitive data entry forms
- DataGridView for expense list
- Calendar view for date selection
- Responsive layout
- Minimal learning curve

## Design Philosophy

### Focus on User Experience

Unlike many enterprise applications, this project prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity over features** - Only what's needed
2. **Speed of entry** - Fast expense logging
3. **Habit formation** - Daily reminders encourage consistency
4. **No cloud complexity** - Everything local and private
5. **Lightweight** - Minimal system resources

### Why WinForms?

Despite being considered "legacy" by some:
- **Fast development** - Rapid prototyping
- **Simple deployment** - Single executable
- **Full .NET 8 support** - Modern framework features
- **Direct OS integration** - Windows notifications, Task Scheduler
- **Lightweight** - No heavy frameworks needed
- **Perfect for desktop-first apps**

## Architecture

### No Repository Pattern

This project intentionally **does not** use Repository pattern because:

1. **Simple domain** - CRUD operations only
2. **Direct EF Core usage** - No abstraction needed
3. **Small codebase** - Easier to maintain without layers
4. **Performance** - No unnecessary abstractions
5. **Learning opportunity** - Shows when patterns aren't needed

### Data Access
```csharp
// Direct DbContext usage in forms
using (var context = new ExpenseContext())
{
    var expenses = await context.Expenses
        .Where(e => e.Date == selectedDate)
        .OrderByDescending(e => e.CreatedAt)
        .ToListAsync();
    
    dataGridView.DataSource = expenses;
}
```

### Database Schema
```
Expenses Table:
- Id (Primary Key)
- Amount (decimal)
- Category (string)
- Date (DateTime)
- Notes (string)
- CreatedAt (DateTime)
```

Simple, flat structure - no complex relationships needed.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Daily Reminder Implementation

**Windows Task Scheduler Integration**:
```csharp
public void SetupDailyReminder()
{
    // Create task scheduler entry
    // Trigger: Daily at 21:00
    // Action: Show notification
}
```

**Notification Display**:
- Windows Toast notification
- Custom message
- Click to open application
- Snooze option

### 2. Expense Entry Form

**Quick Entry Design**:
- Amount TextBox (numeric only)
- Category ComboBox
- Date DatePicker (defaults to today)
- Notes TextBox
- Save Button (Enter key)
- Clear Button (Escape key)

**Validation**:
- Amount must be positive
- Category required
- Date cannot be in future

### 3. Data Visualization

**Simple Charts**:
- Category pie chart
- Daily spending line chart
- Monthly comparison bar chart
- All using built-in Chart controls

### 4. Export Functionality

**Excel Export**:
```csharp
public void ExportToExcel(List<Expense> expenses)
{
    // Create Excel file
    // Add expense data
    // Save to user-selected location
}
```

## User Workflow

1. **Daily at 21:00** → Reminder notification pops up
2. **User clicks notification** → App opens
3. **Quick entry form** → Add today's expenses
4. **Save** → Data stored locally
5. **View reports** → Check spending patterns
6. **Export (optional)** → Save data to Excel

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Daily Reminder Reliability
**Issue**: Application not always running  
**Solution**: Windows Task Scheduler ensures reminder triggers even when app is closed.

### Challenge 2: Fast Data Entry
**Issue**: Traditional forms too slow  
**Solution**: Keyboard shortcuts, auto-focus, Enter to save, minimal clicks required.

### Challenge 3: Data Backup
**Issue**: Local data could be lost  
**Solution**: Easy export to Excel, regular backup reminders, SQLite file can be copied.

## Best Practices Applied

Despite simple architecture:

- **Async/await** for all data operations
- **Using statements** for proper disposal
- **Try-catch blocks** for error handling
- **Validation** before saving
- **Clear method naming** for readability
- **Comments** where logic is complex

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

1. **Not everything needs complex architecture** - Sometimes simple is better
2. **User needs first** - Technology serves the use case
3. **Desktop apps still relevant** - Not everything needs to be web/mobile
4. **Behavior change design** - Daily reminders build habits
5. **.NET 8 versatility** - Same framework for web, desktop, mobile

## Lessons Learned

1. **WinForms + .NET 8** is a powerful combination for desktop apps
2. **Simple architecture** can be the right choice for small applications
3. **User experience** matters more than technical complexity
4. **Pattern overhead** can hurt simple projects
5. **Daily reminders** significantly improve user engagement

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- **Cloud sync** option for multi-device
- **Budget setting** with overspending alerts
- **Receipt photo attachment**
- **Recurring expense templates**
- **Advanced analytics** with ML predictions
- **Mobile companion app**
- **Multi-currency support**

## Conclusion

This project proves that effective software doesn't always require complex architectures. By focusing on user needs, simplicity, and solving a real problem (inconsistent expense tracking), the application delivers value without unnecessary complexity.

**Key Insight**: Choose your architecture based on the problem, not trends. Sometimes a simple WinForms app is exactly what's needed.
